# Drum Set

'Drum set' is a really fun mini-project that employs event listeners and DOM node manipulations. On really cool tidbit of vanilla JS and HTML that I learned was the use of `data-key` as an HTML element attribute.

The use of the `data-key` attribute made it really convenient to query for the element with the correct `keyCode`, and subsequently play the audio that corresponds to the key code.

Another lesson I learned in this mini-project was the use of `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` as opposed to `getElement` and `getElements`. the `query` family of methods allowed for me to query for specific elements with attributes as well.
